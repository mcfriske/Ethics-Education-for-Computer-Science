# If/Else Advertisement Assignment

## Overview
For this homework, you will be creating functions that will output personalized ads **using if/elif/else.** Each problem will present a short scenario and task describing what type of personalized ad should be served. There will be a few guidelines for the type of ad you want to print to the screen, but **you have freedom on the actual text of the advertisment.** Please read the instructions carefully and come to office hours if you have any questions. *You will be graded for effort as well as correctness (i.e. one-word ad text will not receive full credit).*

## Problems
### Problem 1
*Scenario*: You work at an advertising company and your client paid for ads at the lowest tier of personalization; therefore, they only have a small amount of data access—whether a user self-reported that they atleast own a dog.

*Task*: Given a boolean ownsDog (i.e. True or False), write a function that:

- if *ownsDog* is `True`, print text advertising dog food. Your text must start with `"Dog Food Ad: "`.
- if *ownsDog* is `False`, print text advertising anything else. Your text must start with `"Ad: "`.

For example, given `ownsDog = True`, your function might print:
```
Dog Food Ad: Meat’s the need of dogs like yours! The ALL-MEAT dinner for dogs, WOOF.
```
And if `ownsDog = False`, your function might print:
```
Ad: Dirty mouth? Clean it up with new Orbit Raspberry Mint. For a good clean feeling, no matter what!
```
